# Applied Deep Learning - A Case-Based Approach to Understanding Deep Neural Networks

### By Umberto Michelucci

Welcome to the github repository for the book "Applied Deep Learning - A Case-Based Approach to Understanding Deep Neural Networks". Here you will find the jupyter notebooks that I used during the completion of the book. Please note that

- All the code you need is 100% in the book, so you don't need to copy any code from here if you are following the book.
- Here you will find the code I used to produce the figures in the book, in case you are interested or you want to produce the same images.
- The jupyter notebooks you will find here contained **almost** the same code you will find in the book, but sometimes to produce the figures I had to re-run the same piece of code with different parameters, and it may not be reflected in the jupyter notebooks you find here.
- In the notebooks you will find exercises and solutions that you can use in case you are a **teacher**.

**HOW TO USE**: those jupiter notebooks should be used more for looking up how certain figures has been produced, how the code looks like and may require some checking before running. They are **NOT** designed to be run from start to end, or to contain more material or information than the book.

**I hope these jupter notebook can be helpful in case you want to check the code or reproduce some of the figures I have in the book. Especially if you are a teacher and want to do the same I hope you will find some pointers here**.
