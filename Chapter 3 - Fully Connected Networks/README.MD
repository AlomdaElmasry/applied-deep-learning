# Applied Deep Learning - Chapter 3 - Fully Connected Networks

In this folder you will find files that covers Chapter 3 in the book. 
You should start with ```Chapter 3 - Overfitting notebook.ipynb``` that gives a nice introduction to overfitting and 
let's you solve a non-linear regression problem with neural networks: with one layer and with many. You get a chance to 
play with the different hyperparemeters like number of neurons in each layer and with the number of layers.

If you have a bit more experience (or you have gone through the previous notebook) you can start with ```Chapter 3 - Zalando dataset.ipynb```
that does a multiclass classification problem (10 classes) on the 
[Zalando fashion dataset](https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/).

**Note**: the CSV files are also present in this folder but they are zipped (since one file is bigger than 100 Mb and you cannot upload
files bigger than 100 Mb in github). So download the zip files and unzip them before using them.
