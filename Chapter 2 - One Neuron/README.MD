# Applied Deep Learning - Chapter 2

In this repository you will find additional material that is not present in the book. Teaching deep learning I realized 
that depending on your background having more easy cases can help in understanding the core concepts of what is doing a
neuron, how to train it and so on. Therefore I added a few notebooks (with exercises) that should hep beginners.

## Beginners notebooks

The two notebooks

- "Chapter 2 - Easy classification with tensorflow"
- "Chapter 2 - One dimensional linear regression with tensorflow"

Contains easy cases with datasets built just for testing. In both you get to build and train one single neuron to solve 
regression and classification problems.

## Advanced notebooks

In the other notebooks you will the code I used in the book with the same examples. The titles should be pretty self-explanatory.
