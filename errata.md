# Errata for *Applied Deep Learning by Umberto Michelucci*

On **page 36** [#(3) should not be in the formula]:
 
At page 36 the second formula from above has at the end a "#(3)". It should not be there. Is not part of the formula.

***

On **page89** [Formulas are wrong]

At page 89 two formulas have a mistake in it. In the formulas Z^[1] should be \hat Y^[1] and Z^[2] should be \hat Y^[2].
