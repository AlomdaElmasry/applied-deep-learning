# Applied Deep Learning - Chapter 4 - Network Training

In this folder you will find files that covers Chapter 4 in the book. 

Please note that the notebook marked with "reference" at the end of the name, are notebooks that you may use if you are interested to know how I generated specific images in the book. They are not self-explanatory and are probably not very easy to understand or very well programmed. But I tought they may be useful. The others are much better structures and have several exercises you may try to do to learn more about the material in the book.
